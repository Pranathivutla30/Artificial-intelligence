# ü§ñ AI Final Project Repository ‚Äì Churn Prediction & Model Evaluation

Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence project repository! This repository showcases two AI projects developed as part of my academic coursework, focused on building, evaluating, and interpreting machine learning classification models using real-world data. It also includes a comprehensive PDF report explaining the methods, results, and conclusions drawn from the projects.

## üìÅ Project Files

This repository includes the following:

- üîπ **[AI Final Project.ipynb](https://github.com/Pranathivutla30/Artificial-intelligence/blob/main/AI%20Final%20Project.ipynb)**  
  A complete machine learning pipeline that predicts customer churn using logistic regression. This notebook demonstrates data cleaning, feature selection, data normalization, model training, and evaluation using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

- üìÑ **[Project Report.pdf](https://github.com/Pranathivutla30/Artificial-intelligence/blob/main/Project%20Report.pdf)**  
  A detailed document summarizing both projects, including objectives, methodology, results, plots, insights, and conclusions. Ideal for understanding the theoretical and practical motivations behind the notebooks.

- üîπ **[second project.ipynb](https://github.com/Pranathivutla30/Artificial-intelligence/blob/main/second%20project.ipynb)**  
  This notebook dives deeper into model interpretability. It visualizes model performance using tools like ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves, learning curves, and confusion matrices. This helps in understanding not just *how* the model performs, but *why* it behaves a certain way.

## üß† Methodology

1. **Dataset**  
   The dataset used focuses on customer churn, where the target variable indicates whether a customer left the service.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Null values handling  
   - Encoding categorical features  
   - Feature scaling using Standard Scaler  
   - Splitting into training and testing sets

3. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression was used due to its simplicity and interpretability in binary classification tasks.
   - Evaluation performed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and support values.
   - Visualization methods included ROC curves, PR curves, and learning curves.

4. **Interpretability**  
   - The second notebook visualizes model strengths and weaknesses.
   - Helps in diagnosing where the model fails or performs well.

5. **Reporting**  
   - Final findings were compiled into a structured PDF with visuals, tables, and interpretation.
   - Ethical reflections and future improvements are also discussed in the report.

## üìä Key Visualizations

- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows true/false positives and negatives for classification results.
- **ROC Curve & AUC Score**: Indicates how well the model separates classes.
- **Precision-Recall Curve**: Especially important for imbalanced data scenarios.
- **Learning Curves**: Helps identify underfitting or overfitting patterns.
